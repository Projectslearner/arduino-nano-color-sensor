### Color Sensor with Arduino Nano

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a color sensor with an Arduino Nano to detect and measure RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values of different objects or surfaces. With this sensor, you can distinguish between different colors and integrate color detection into your Arduino projects.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Color Sensor (Adafruit TCS34725)**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Color Sensor Connection:**
   - Connect the color sensor to the Arduino Nano using the I2C interface.
   - Make sure to connect the sensor's power (VCC) and ground (GND) pins to the appropriate pins on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the SDA pin of the sensor to the A4 (SDA) pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the SCL pin of the sensor to the A5 (SCL) pin on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the color sensor to the Arduino Nano as described above.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE.
   - Observe the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values printed in the serial monitor as you place different colored objects in front of the sensor.

#### Applications

- **Color Detection:** Use the sensor to detect and distinguish between different colors in your projects.
- **Color Sorting:** Implement color-based sorting systems for objects based on their colors.
- **Color Analysis:** Analyze the color composition of objects for various applications such as colorimetry or color grading.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper calibration and lighting conditions for accurate color detection.
- Experiment with different surfaces and lighting conditions to understand how they affect color detection.
